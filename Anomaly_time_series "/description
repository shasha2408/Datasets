- Multi variate time series analysis - outlier / anomaly identification.<br>

- There are 509k samples with 11 features.<br>

- Each instance / row is one moment in time.<br>

- 0.09% of rows are identified as events, basically rare, outliers / anomalies<br>

- Task is to identify these events in this time series - time series classification<br> 

- As dataset is unbalanced, the metric to use is **F1 score**(not accuracy, nor ROC AUC)
